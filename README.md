# Cadmus Graph Studio V2

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.1. This is the second generation of the [original studio app](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-graph-studio-app).

This is a minimalist editor for helping users build their graph mapping rules.

- [library overview](./projects/myrmidon/cadmus-mapping-builder/README.md)
- üëâ [documentation](https://myrmex.github.io/overview/cadmus/graph-studio/graph-studio/)

üêã Docker:

1. `npm run build-lib`;
2. update [env.js](./src/env.js) version number and version numbers in [docker compose](docker-compose.yml);
3. `ng build`;
4. build image like (change version number accordingly):

```bash
docker build . -t vedph2020/cadmus-graph-studio-app:0.1.0 -t vedph2020/cadmus-graph-studio-app:latest
```

For production:

(1) build as above for 1-3.
(2) in `dist/cadmus-graph-studio/env.js` replace the host address (and eventually version number by appending `-prod`) as follows:

```js
window.__env.apiUrl = "https://cadmus-graph-studio-api.fusi-soft.com/api/";
```

(3) build prod image:

```bash
docker build . -t vedph2020/cadmus-graph-studio-app:0.0.11-prod
```

## Debug Hints

If you need to debug the tree:

1. always _build_ the library first before linking.
2. in your _source_ workspace root, run `npm link dist/myrmidon/paged-data-browsers`.
3. in your _target_ workspace root, run `npm link @myrmidon/paged-data-browser`.
4. later, to unlink, in your _target_ workspace root run `npm unlink @myrmidon/paged-data-browser` and `npm install` to reinstall the original package.

You don't need to uninstall the NPM package first. The `npm link` command will temporarily override the installed package without removing it from your package.json or node_modules. The original package stays in node_modules and package.json; `npm link` creates a symbolic link that takes precedence. When you `npm unlink`, it removes the symbolic link and falls back to the original package.

You can check if the link is active by looking at `node_modules/@myrmidon/paged-data-browser`: it should show as a symbolic link (folder icon with an arrow on Windows).

When you revert with `npm unlink @myrmidon/paged-data-browser`, the original package from npm will be used again automatically.
